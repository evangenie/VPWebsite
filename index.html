								<h2>How I Lead</h2>
								<p>My leadership philosophy is simple: leadership is an <b>ACTION</b>, not a <b>TITLE</b> or <b>POSITION</b>. <br/>I firmly believe that words mean nothing if there is no action backing them up. <br/>I am running to be a class officer so that we can work together to make our senior year the <b>BEST</b> year.</p>

								<h2>Communication</h2>
								<p> In order to communicate effectively with the rest of the class, I would like to implement a quarterly newsletter. This newsletter would briefly summarize our class’ accomplishments and events that quarter, and would be designed to appeal to the eye.</p>

								<h2>Transparency</h2>
								<p>Transparency is a key trait I believe our class can improve upon. The current senior class has important information such as their class finances located on their class website for their entire class to view with ease. Since a majority of our class currently uses FaceBook, the class website is rarely visited. However, I believe that if we revamp this website and update it with important information regularly, we would increase the overall traffic to the site.

								<h2>Proactivity</h2>
								<p>I want to get things done in order to make the class better for all of us. This year, Leadership 2 hosted its first Town Hall, where students are able to ask questions and voice their opinions about our ASB and L2 team. Town Hall was made specifically to help the student body and improve on any errors they believe we made. I believe that this format of a “meeting” would benefit our class immensely. Many students have opinions and suggestions they would like to make, but either never get the chance to voice them, or often feel too awkward to go up to a class officer. Through this “Town Hall” setting, we will be able to target the needs of every student. </p>
